        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Project Overview
            Soul Plane is a small regional airline that has a fleet of under 50 planes and sells tickets for ~30 direct
            flights each week. The airline serves around 500 customers a week and has an annual revenue of roughly $15
            million. The database for this airline will store data for its flights each week, and each flight will go
            from one airport to another using a particular plane in the fleet and contain a certain number of
            passengers. The airline will use this database to maintain data about their current fleet and record flights
            as transactions involving a plane flying from one airport to another with a number of associated passengers.
